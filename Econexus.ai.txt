SKILL SETS TO OFFER
1) Biodiversity Sampling & Mapping
The skill of collecting biological data from the ocean—such as species observations, water samples, and habitat characteristics—and translating it into spatial maps.
It includes using tools like transects, underwater surveys, drones, and sonar to document what lives where, how populations change over time, and which areas are ecologically sensitive or under threat.

2) Creation of a Digital Twin
Building a virtual, data-driven replica of a marine ecosystem that updates as new information comes in.
A digital twin can simulate ocean conditions, species movement, human impact (e.g., fishing, pollution), and conservation scenarios—allowing stakeholders to test decisions before acting in the real environment.

3) eDNA (Environmental DNA) Analysis
A method of detecting species by analyzing tiny genetic traces they leave behind in seawater—such as skin cells, waste, or mucus.
It enables non-invasive identification of marine species, including rare or hard-to-observe organisms. It helps track biodiversity changes quickly across large areas without the need for traditional capture or visual surveys.
SKILL SETS TO OFFER (TECHNICAL)
1) Biodiversity Sampling & Mapping (Technical)
The systematic acquisition of biological and ecological data from marine environments using standardized field methodologies.
Techniques include belt and line transects, quadrats, ROV/AUV-based video surveys, benthic grabs, and hydroacoustic profiling to quantify species presence, abundance, and community structure.
Collected data are georeferenced and integrated into GIS-based spatial models, enabling analysis of species distribution patterns, habitat suitability, alpha/beta diversity indices, and temporal shifts driven by environmental variables such as SST, salinity, chlorophyll, and substrate composition.

2) Creation of a Digital Twin (Technical)
The development of a dynamic, computationally coupled virtual model of a marine ecosystem that assimilates real-time and historical observational datasets.
A digital twin integrates physical oceanographic models (e.g., ROMS, HYCOM), biogeochemical cycles, habitat layers, and biological population models, with continuous updates from sensors, remote sensing, and field surveys.
It enables predictive simulations of ecosystem responses to perturbations—such as fishing pressure, nutrient loading, climate-driven variability, or habitat restoration—supporting scenario testing, forecasting, and adaptive management based on feedback loops between the model and in situ measurements.

3) Environmental DNA (eDNA) Analysis (Technical)
A molecular approach that detects species by extracting and sequencing extracellular and cellular DNA fragments shed into the water column.
Workflows involve water filtration, DNA extraction, and PCR-based amplification (qPCR, digital droplet PCR) or metabarcoding using universal markers (e.g., COI, 12S, 16S rRNA), followed by high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic taxonomic assignment against curated reference databases.
eDNA enables high-sensitivity detection of cryptic, rare, or low-density taxa, supports community composition profiling, and can quantify relative abundance signals—while minimizing spatial disturbance and bypassing traditional capture-based sampling constraints.
